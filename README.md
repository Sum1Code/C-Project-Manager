# C-Project-Manager
## What is C-Project-Manager?
C-Project-Manager (CPM) is a header only library containing a custom build system that also has some package manager capabilities **(CPM CLI / PACKAGE MANAGER IS STILL WIP)**

## Is it better than make / cmake?
I would still recommend you to use make or cmake in your projects that is going into production since this particular build system / package manager has practically no community support and is made by just one person. 

## Then why should I use this thing?
I dont know, and I dont care if you use this thing or not, the only positive thing about this system is it's all C integrated and can be expanded with C.
